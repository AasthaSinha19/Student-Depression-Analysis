<h1 align="center">🔍 Project Title: Student Depression Analysis Using AI/ML</h1>
<p align="center">
  A Machine Learning project analyzing key factors behind student depression using real-world lifestyle, academic, and psychological data.
</p>

## 📌 Overview

Mental health is a growing concern among students. This project leverages **AI and ML** to predict student depression based on features like **academic pressure, sleep duration, CGPA, suicidal thoughts, and financial stress**. Using Python-based data processing, visualization, and classification models, this notebook uncovers patterns that impact student well-being. 

## 🎯 Key Features

 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

-The dataset is read properly.
-Missing value checks were conducted.
-Categorical features like Gender, City, Profession, etc., are identified.
-Data types are inferred correctly and converted where needed.

 🤖 **ML Classification Models:**
 
 -Models implemented : Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN
 
- Each model includes:
- Splitting of data (train-test)
- Accuracy and classification reports
- Confusion Matrix Visualization.

 🧼 **Preprocessing:**
  
- Label Encoding/Categorical mapping is applied for model readiness alongwith null handling.
- Features and target are selected appropriately.

 📈 **Visualization:** 
 
- Visuals are used to explore:
- Depression level vs CGPA, sleep duration, academic pressure
- Countplots and barplots for depression by various categories
- Accuracy and classification reports
- Confusion Matrix Visualization

📈 **Results Summary :**

- Logistic Regression: ~83% Accuracy
- Random Forest: ~90% Accuracy
- KNN: ~78–85% Accuracy

## 🛠 Insights
Identifies academic pressure, low sleep, and financial stress as high-risk indicators.
Depression correlates with multiple overlapping factors.
Random Forest shows the best accuracy in classification.

## 🔮 Future Scope

Integrate deep learning (e.g., LSTM or ANN) for longitudinal prediction  
Connect with mental health apps or APIs for real-time mood tracking

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Language:** Python 3.x  
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
**IDE:** Jupyter Notebook

🚀 This project not only highlights the power of machine learning in understanding mental health, but also lays the foundation for building supportive tools that can make a real difference in students' lives.
